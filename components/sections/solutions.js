        <h4>Support by Community</h4>
        <p>
          Artists require a stable production cost to eliminate the economic uncertainty in the production of their work. In Piction Network, community members are able to safely support into budding artists using PXLP Tokens and receive a cut of the productionâ€™s profits.

        <h4>Greater Ancillary Support for Artists</h4>
        <p>
          Piction Network will help artists to leverage the power of the community. When supporters of an artist helps in marketing and outreach beyond Piction Network and when these efforts convert into sales for the artist, these supporters would be rewarded with PXLP Tokens.
