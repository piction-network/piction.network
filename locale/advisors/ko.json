For too long, extractive intermediaries in the content value chain have extracted profits from artists that prevents them from earning sufficient livelihood. What we are seeing today is the stagnation of the contents industry because promising artists do not have sufficient funds to continue creating valuable content. I applaud Piction Network’s vision and the team has my full support."

        "__html": "In just a few years, we have seen the rise of extractive monopolies in the digital contents industry. The high fees and barriers to entry crowd out aspiring artists who wish to pursue their dreams and career in the contents industry. What we are seeing today is an unfortunate reality where even promising artists second-guess their decisions to enter the contents industry. This is not right and something that should not have even happened. Piction Network, undergirded by blockchain technology seeks to return power to these artists, and in the long term, allow the digital contents industry to once again flourish."

        "__html": "Being deep in the digital contents industry myself, it is truly saddening to see aspiring artists not being able to see their ideas and dreams come to fruition because of the extractive nature of today’s digital contents industry. Clamouring for change on the ground is not enough. Many artists have voiced their concerns, but the reality on the ground is still the same. The onset of blockchain technology is one that brings huge relief to me and artists because it facilitates the disintermediation of extractive monopolies in the value chain. Artists with Piction Network can now have greater freedom to innovate and bring greater value to our daily lives. When the arts industry flourishes, we as humankind flourish as well. I am deeply touched the fervour exhibited by the team behind Piction Network. The team has my utmost support."
